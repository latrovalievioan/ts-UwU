Pushing the boundaries of my knowledge about TypeScript.

- This is a project where I aim to solve simple(and not so simple) algorhytmic challanges using only the TypeScript's type system. :computer:
- If you would like to check out what the project is all about, just clone it. :eyes:
- The only thing you need is a TypeScript language server.(Your IDE probably has one) :floppy_disk:
- Hover over the ``` type Test ``` in any file to see the magic. :exclamation:
